  """Define kernel size which is automatically reduced for small input.

  If the shape of the input images is unknown at graph construction time this
  function assumes that the input images are is large enough.

  Args:
    input_tensor: input tensor of size [batch_size, height, width, channels].
    kernel_size: desired kernel size of length 2: [kernel_height, kernel_width]

  Returns:
    a tensor with the kernel size.

  TODO(jrru): Make this function work with unknown shapes. Theoretically, this
  can be done with the code below. Problems are two-fold: (1) If the shape was
  known, it will be lost. (2) inception.slim.ops._two_element_tuple cannot
  handle tensors that define the kernel size.
